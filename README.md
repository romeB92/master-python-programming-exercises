After you finished the begginers, functions and loops series; This series will really prepare you for your next job or any any other programming challenge. Practice everything there you need to know to build algorithms with python, from intermadiate to hard challenges: The entire tutorial is 👆 interactive, ✅ auto-graded and with. 📹 video tutorials.

These exercises were built in collaboration, we need you! If you find any bugs or misspells please contribute and report them.

## One click installation (recommended):

You can open these exercises in just a few seconds by clicking: [Open in Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/?repo=4GeeksAcademy/master-python-programming-exercises) (recommended) or [Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io#https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/master-python-programming-exercises).

> Once you have VSCode open the LearnPack exercises should start automatically. If exercises don't run automatically you can try typing on your terminal: `$ learnpack start`


## Local Installation

1. Install learnpack, the package manager for learning tutorials and the html compiler plugin for learnpack, make sure you also have node.js 14+:

```
$ npm i learnpack -g
$ learnpack plugins:install learnpack-python
```

2. Download this particular exercise using learnpack and `cd` into the folder:

```
$ learnpack download master-python-programming-exercises
$ cd master-python-programming-exercises
```

> Note: Once you finish downloading, you will find a "exercises" folder that contains all the exercises within.

3. Start the tutorial/exercises by running the following command at the same level were your bc.json file is:

```sh
$ RUN  pip3 install pytest==4.4.2 pytest-testdox mock
$ learnpack start
```

<!-- endhide -->

## How are the exercises organized?

Each exercise is a small react application containing the following files:

1. **app.py:** represents the entry python file that will be executed by the computer.
2. **README.md:** contains exercise instructions.
3. **test.py:** you don't have to open this file, it contains the testing script for the exercise.

> Note: The exercises have automatic grading but its very rigid and string, my recomendation is to ignore the tests and use them only as a recomendation or you can get frustrated.
